            <h2>Circular Economy?</h2>
            <p>
                A circular economy in Edinburgh, and the whole of Scotland, is a huge opportunity.  
                Circular Economies revolutionise the way we view and use resources, designing waste out, reducing energy consumption and the carbon footprint of all aspects of our society.
                It also brings cross sector collaboration, innovation, business and job creation opportunities. </p>
            <h2>An Edinburgh Network?</h2>
            <p>A truly circular economy requires collaboration within sectors, verticals and across all sectors.</p>
            <p>
                Edinburgh has a number of thriving & growing Circular (& Sharing) Economy areas, this includes the start-up and business community, the Universities & policy areas and social enterprises and the 3rd sector. 
                With widening understanding of the climate crisis and a growing awareness of circularity plus the recent introduction of the Scotland Circular Economy bill, 
                this is the ideal time for a city wide network to connect us all.
                <br />
                Our hope is that the Network will link related Edinburgh communities, circular initiatives and bodies to enable and support more successful circular impact. 
                By combining Edinburgh's unique position and strengths we can further help position Scotland as a world circular economy leader.
            </p>
